J. Cole GPT
This repository contains code to fine-tune the GPT-NEOX-20B model on a text file containing J. Cole's lyrics. The text file is preprocessed to create a prompt and completion for each verse.

Please excuse the high levels of profanity in the lyrics. The sample data was chosen as it is relatively straight-forward to train and as such is a great introduction for a learner like myself to GPT fine tuning.

This project is a work in progress and later versions will be trained on more sophisticated GPT models such as OpenAI's "text-curie-001" and "text-davinci-003". 
The end goal is to have a sophisticated model which can generate unique and impressive rap verses based on a roster of high-profile rappers including but not limited to:
J. Cole, Drake, Immortal Technique, Kendrick Lamar, Tyler The Creator, Andre 3000, Eminem.
Future iterations will additionally be trained to generate completions based on prompts such as "story-telling" (think Stan by Eminem) or "clever wordplay" or cadence or rhyme schemes etc etc...

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
The Hugging Face transformers library
Usage
To use the code, clone the repository and install the required libraries:

//
git clone https://github.com/your-username/j-cole-gpt.git
pip install transformers
Set the path to the lyrics file in the lyrics_path variable. Then run the code:

//
python main.py
The fine-tuned model will be saved to the model directory.

Credits
The GPT-NEOX-20B model was trained by EleutherAI.
The lyrics text file was obtained from Kaggle.
