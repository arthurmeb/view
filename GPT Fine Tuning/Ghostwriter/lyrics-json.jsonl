{"prompt":"Write a rap verse in the style of Immortal Technique: ","completion":" This is the business, and y'all ain't getting nothing for free And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company You could call it reparations or restitution Lock and load, nigga. Industrial revolution Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale. They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed Niggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that. The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you. There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely, and I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem. Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism. You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials. But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources I'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words. My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America. Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States; places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined. And that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people. \"Fuck them, let them fend for themselves.\" No, Fuck you, they are you. No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them. They're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in. And whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living. No, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money. We have whatever they kick down to us. My enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies. The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real Mother-Fuckers that I need to bring it to, not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up In fact, I have more in common with most working and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people. As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue. Many of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie Mother-Fuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole In other words, I don't want to escape the plantation I want to come back, free all my people, hang the Mother-Fucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground. I want to take over the encomienda And give it back to the people who work the land You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a Fucking lethargic devil. I don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole. Most of those successful individuals are sell-outs and house Negros But, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto. Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor. That's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture and forms of government. You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois league. The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of white Spaniards once he was captured. Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans So in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community And represent what's good for all of us proletariat Porque sino entonces te mando por el carajo cabron gusano hijo de puta, seramos libre pronto, viva la revolucion, VIVA LA REVOLUCION Yeah, Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder Like those motherfuckers runnin' away from the Twin Towers Gunshots rock the Earth like a meteor shower Bowlin' For Columbine, fear givin' the media power Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box Government cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock Corrupt cops' false testimony at your arraignment Check to check, constant struggle to make the payments Workin' your whole life, wonderin' where the day went The subway stays packed like a multi-cultural slave ship It's rush hour, 2:30 to 8, non stoppin' And people comin' home after corporate sharecroppin' And fuck flossin'!

We're here because of you. We're here because you were there. We've arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America. We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the well-being of the people; it's only about profit. Everything elseâ€”their image, their human resources, their public relationsâ€”only exist to protect the reality behind it. Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us, and so they privatized everything. Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart. They didn't care about our survival or well-beingâ€”they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources. They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism, and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them. Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy, and that we would have freedom, but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom, the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table. Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God. (Open your eyes before you die) And while some used missionaries and donations to off-set this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease, and sanctions that killed millions. They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enabled them, restored them and kept them in power. They became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, governments of thievery. They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits. The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy, and even overthrow democratically elected governments. And so the age of revolution began again. They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market. But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself. It is manipulated like a puppet, and it survives because of its image. Destroy the image, and the enemy will die. Such is the same in the rap industry. But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World. When they need new assets, new artists to prostitute a side-ins, and put on a shelf to use their songs; when they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the Third World. They took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us. But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need them to succeed. They're no better than us. Their economic advertising was always a lie. A few got rich, but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure. Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelry, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide jeans, 20-year contracts, and oil blood money. Build your defenses, my independent brothers and sisters. They'll stop at nothing to get what they want. They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward.

Not against the forces of a colonial kingdom, but a rebellion against an oppressor that has risen among us It is not a foreign invasion we have to fear, rather the threat of a force within our nation that has usurped what was once a dream of having the greatest democracy ever known to man We now live in a world where the population has grown exponentially And the planet is running out of resources to sustain us all. We in the inner-city and those struggling in the suburban ghettos may not realize it yet, but make no mistake, the people who control the technology and run every enterprise that makes up our world have seen this coming for a long time. The ideas of renewable energy, global warming, the idea of collectively working were purposefully bought out, derailed, demonized, or corrupted in favor of an economic structure designed by a monetary caste system In a desperate attempt to convince us that we need to maintain that extravagant existence, they've pretended we might share in their dream That we can justify any inhumanity in its name. Out of this blind ignorance was born the curse of slavery. Many of the founders of this nation were themselves Masons. That is not a Left wing or Right wing conspiracy theory. It is a widely known and accepted fact So then explain to me how a nation founded by men who not only understood the long and complicated history of Europe, but also that of Africa could permeate such a lie in convincing the American public that one race of men was superior and one inferior. When, in fact, we know that all the early men the people who created civilization and every aspect of what we see today, the foundation of all modern human life, were from Africa The greatest cowardice of course came not with slavery itself, unfortunately. But with the excuses for slavery. For if America had been as brave as the Roman Empire and all other empires that have come after her, and claimed \"No, we were just stronger and that's why we took you,\" then when slavery was over, racism would've probably followed in suit But instead it was the social lie, the religious lie that was told that stayed in the minds of people that separated one human being from another. In order to distract us from the issues of class and freedom, they created issues around religion and race to dominate the world for centuries to come Some claim that they respect the culture of life in this country. They cry out for indignity of children that are slaughtered before they are born. But God has not penetrated their souls, for they have no empathy. Nothing in their cold hearts for the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken in our wars overseas, for that which they call \"collateral damage,\" which are the burnt and damaged children of the world. They have no prayers for them. Only snide commentary on the internet and laughter in their hearts. And yet you claim to be one with God? We talk about immigration in this country. Might doesn't make right, ladies and gentleman; it just makes right now. What we are saying to the rest of the world is, one day, when America grows weak, one day when her legions falter, on the day when her economy crumbles... China, Russia, Europe, whatever power has arisen... all you have to do is come here and conquer us in a few military excursions, and then you too can set up shop here, and in 100 years you can tell every red-blooded American, \"No, you are an illegal human being. I am the true citizen. I have all the rights. You have no rights.\" Maybe you forgot how you got this country. Maybe you take for granted the blood, the sweat, the tears, that the people who live in practical serfdom shed everyday. For we may not run America, but we make America run We talk about the Law, yet how many indignities have been legal in the past? How many treaties with Native American people have we broken? How many international laws have we violated? And, speaking of laws how can a corporation be regulated by a government that is funded and controlled by corporations? How can there be accountability for people who see a profit margin above the lives of Americans? Above the lives of human beings in other countries? We have taken the soul out of ourselves and placed them inside machines My words, of course, will be marginalized, demonized in typical fashion. Any time you dare to question the power structure they say you hate America. No, I love this country. I see its beauty every day in its people. And I love it a lot more than those who have abandoned the American worker that have chose to exploit and try to take away every single benefit she has, those that attempt to make excuses for every atrocity committed, in the name of supposed freedom. Those who demand accountability from everyone, but offer none themselves... who favor contracts over lives... Who favor invasion and control over organic democracy overseas The greatest flaw that any intelligent person has is to think that they're smarter than everyone else. And so as the government has planted its spies amongst us, we have planted our spies among them. They have infiltrated every branch of the American government.

Ahahahahahahaaa! Look, let me make something abundantly clear for people that are so bereft of activities they feel like they gotta comment on every one of mine. First of all, being a vegetarian should never be associated with being a revolutionary or being open-mindedâ€”that's a dietary choice. If someone wants to proliferate the type of ignorance we're supposed to be fighting by thinking that, you're just fuckin' yourself. I don't go around promoting beef and poultry, shoving it in people's faces, I don't castigate people for not eating steak sandwiches, and I would never diss someone for being a fuckin' broccoli head, or living off radishes or eating grass with tofu. I like a lot of vegan cuisine, but the illogicality of expecting everyone to adopt your particular idea of what being healthy is, is just preposterous. I've seen some of you herbivores, and if you wanna argue health, y'all need to eat some kind of supplement, because some of y'all are so skinny that it's disgusting. Lookin' like the only hip hop motherfuckas on Schindler's list. Being a malnutrition ass got nothing to do with being revolutionary or being on point. I'll be damned if I let somebody else push their agenda on me. You know, I don't eat pork, not 'cause I'm a Muslimâ€”I just don't really like it, but I really will fuck a bird up, and fish is good when that shit is fresh. It's like my nigga Vast Aire from Can' Ox said, \"If you don't like the smell of burning meat, then get the fuck off the planet!\" You know, I don't criticize people for eating moss. And don't open your fuckin' mouth about my food, man! I like beef and broccoli, motherfucka. Mind your goddamn business! Matter of fact, you know what? I'm out. I feel like asome arroz con pollo, a banana daiquiri, and a motherfuckin bistec empanado. You have to speak the truth You have to speak your mind###"}

Oh yeah, don't forget \"Revolutionary Vol. 3\" comin soon You're not worthy, you sons-of-bitches! To think about the origins of Hip-Hop in this culture and also about Homeland Security is to see that there are, at the very least, two worlds in America: one of the well-to-do and another of the struggling. For if ever there was the absence of Homeland Security, it is seen in the gritty roots of Hip-Hop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty. In the broader society, the opposite is true, for here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so wide spread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. They're very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence, or the U.S Department of Justice. They're just words, they have very little relationship to reality. Now do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon?
